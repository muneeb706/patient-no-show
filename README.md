# Patient No Show Predictive Modeling

This project contains [notebook](https://github.com/muneeb706/patient-no-show/blob/main/Patient_NoShow_Predictive_Modeling.ipynb) and [final report](https://github.com/muneeb706/patient-no-show/blob/main/Muneeb_Final_Report.pdf) that explains all the steps followed for evaluating performance of <strong>RIPPER</strong> and <strong>Hoeffding Tree Algorithm</strong> in solving patient no-show problem. For this project, <strong>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)</strong> has been used for the feature selection despite the fact that this method does not have any correlation with the methods used for prediction but, I wanted to study, how this method helps us in achieving interpretability in feature selection process regardless of the type of predictive models.

I have used [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments) for this study.
